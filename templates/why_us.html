                                <p>Trekking to the Annapurna Base Camp is best done in the spring (March, April, and May), fall (September, October, and November), till mid-December. More specifically, October is considered as the ideal month to hike to the Annapurna Base Camp. The sky is clear, the weather is mostly constant, and the sights are spectacular. Additionally, the pleasant weather during these months adds to the full enjoyment of the journey.

The trek is also achievable during winter as it offers dry air and clear views, but with the chances of snowfall and sub-zero temperatures. It makes for a quiet hike if you can withstand the cold. However, monsoon isn&#39;t recommended due to slippery paths and landslides.</p>

                                <p>What to bring for the 10 days ABC Trek is one of the most important things to consider. Without the proper tools, getting about might be challenging. You can either bring the gear with you or shop them in Kathmandu. There are more than enough trekking gear shops in Thamel, and you will get a great deal.

Here is a general idea of what you will need for your hike.
*Hiking boots
*Sandals/Crocs
*Several sets of undergarments
*Good quality down jacket and pants
*Fleece jacket
*Warm woolen clothes for the night</p>

                                <p>You can recharge your phone and camera batteries at the teahouses by paying for energy. The service could be offered freely by the tea house where you spend the night. Since solar energy provides electricity, winter months present certain reliability issues. Having extra batteries or power banks on hand is typically a smart idea.</p>

                                <p>As we will be starting our trek from a relatively lower altitude and gradually ascending to a higher altitude every day, there&#39;s no need for an acclimatization day during our 10 Days ABC trek. The maximum altitude we reach is only 4100 m which is quite low compared to EBC. In case you feel uneasy while trekking, you can inform the guide, and they will decide what&#39;s best for you and the group.</p>

                                <p>Yes, you need to get travel insurance for trekking to ABC. The Himalayas is full of surprises. You never know what&#39;s waiting for you.

                                <p>Yes. It is a short 15-20 minutes flight that usually takes off on time. However, if the visibility is unclear, you might have to wait for the air to clear up. In case of any problems with the flights, we will arrange a luxury tourist bus for you that only takes 6-7 hours to reach Pokhara from Kathmandu. This, however, might slightly lengthen the trip.</p>
